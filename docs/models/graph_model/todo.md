- [ ] Find a solution to how to refer Existing types in the model schema or refer them later. What this means is instead of typedesc in variables, we might want to refer to an existing type in the schema using just the name of the type. (This is a low priority task)



Simple solution. 
 - Model is only for modeling, and defining the types. Only Types, No functions
 - Implementation is only for implementation.
 - No Variable concept, only node output types, and input only for Events
